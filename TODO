*   improve testing and documentation (always ...)
*   get a profiling workflow in place, start identifying some bottlenecks
*   add production lookup functionality to Tidal and Wind (lookup tables not quite the same thing as passing a production time series)
*   will probably need to de-couple normalized performance data from the assets themselves (or each reset will trigger a new disk read ...)
*   implement model predictive control in Controller (means getting linear programming functionality in here ... need to find a good solution for that)
*   implement Python Controller API (to allow users to define their own control algorithms); this will hurt runtime performance, but greatly increase modelling flexibility
